# MASK-14E: Black top hat

Inherit the complete [family contract](MASK-14_residuals_contract.md) and
[MASK-common](MASK_common_contract.md). This member is Proposed and unimplemented;
the proposed name is not a current registry entry or a compatibility alias.

## Ports, parameters and output inference

input: Coverage or Binary[H,W] -> values: same dtype/shape

Required static parameters: MASK-05 footprint schema. Values and controls use the stated
port order. Infer ordinary output dimensions from descriptors/statics only;
Static Tensor capacities, payload counts and source-association rules, where relevant, are those of the family.
No hidden default, conversion, color/alpha inference or optional port is added.

## Mathematics and exact request behavior

RN_T(C(I)-I) using exact family stage semantics; result Coverage/Binary, not signed Field.

H: (Q+B+B) intersect D, with proper extended intermediate. Empty Q adds no runtime payload work; static schema checks still apply.
The family defines mathematical Data/Control support, border extension and
rounding stages. Lower the selected complete output tiles to fixed input-tile
reads, using a finite conservative superset for runtime-dependent addressing.
There is no payload Validation read set or runtime dependency discovery.

## Implementation, resource and failure obligations

Use the family reference algorithm and its stated work/scratch bounds. Strict
CPU is the initial target; no implicit accelerated/GPU/third-party fallback is
registered. Exact choices/copies stay exact; arithmetic uses the inherited
rounding boundary and unchecked numerical premises. Account for output, scratch,
exact state, retained source owners and all simultaneous intermediates. Poll
inside long loops/refinement. Selected outputs of one call share its publication
outcome; failure exposes no partial call Result. Already retired call exports
remain valid. Preserve host upstream/cancellation/resource status and immutable
owner lifetime.

## Independent acceptance and conceptual workflow

3x3 ring with center0 -> residual center1; full1x1 ->0, never -1.

Independent reference entry: `black_top_hat` in
[`mask14/reference.py`](../../../../oracle/ops/mask_morphology/mask14/reference.py).
Its small-image oracle and fixtures are not a production implementation and
do not exercise kernel registration, resource accounting or compiled tile reads.
Run the [suite commands](../../../../oracle/ops/mask_morphology/README.md),
then add the relevant common fixed-tile support, valid special-value, static
structural-parameter, dtype, correctly paired association, cancellation and
owner-lifetime checks before implementation acceptance. Invalid payload or
numerical-premise fixtures diagnose oracle requests only; they do not require
production rejection.

Conceptual DAG: explicit input preparation -> this member -> an explicit
mask/measurement/image consumer appropriate to the listed output. A real
Compiler/ExecutionContext workflow is still required after registration; this
document does not invent a callable public API. Sources and compatibility
limits are recorded in the family and [research notes](../research-sources.md).
