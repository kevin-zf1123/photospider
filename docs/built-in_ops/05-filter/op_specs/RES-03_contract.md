# RES-03: Wavelet Denoising

Coefficient thresholding and finite cycle-spinning workflow. Statistical assumptions for converting sigma to thresholds are not hidden in algorithm defaults.

This specification defines the intended mathematics and interface contract only; it makes no claim about current implementation or registration. It inherits the [FILTER common contract](FILTER_common_contract.md), [NUM](../../01-numeric/op_specs/NUM_common_contract.md), and [FMT](../../02-format-color/op_specs/FMT_common_contract.md). No member has been marked Accepted or as a production implementation.

## Members

| ID | Function Spec | Kind | Numeric Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RES-03A | [Wavelet detail thresholding](RES-03A_threshold_wavelet_details.md) | primitive | E+copy |
| RES-03B | [Wavelet denoising with a fixed shift set](RES-03B_cycle_spin_wavelet_denoise.md) | authoring_helper | S |

Suffix letters denote distinct mathematical/interface objects, not quality tiers that a backend may choose arbitrarily. A primitive may propose strict and accelerated profiles; a helper only orchestrates explicit stages.

## Shared Mathematics, Units, and Profiles

See each member file listed above for its formula. Members do not share undeclared implicit preprocessing. Parameters with the same name are reusable only when their units, boundaries, normalization, and RN stages match.

## Shared Execution and Numeric Obligations

E denotes evaluation of the exact expression followed by one final RN_t; B denotes explicitly generated, fixed coefficients; S denotes explicitly staged rounding. See the [numeric reference](FILTER_numeric_reference.md). Ordinary arithmetic propagates NaN, Inf, floating-point overflow, signed zero, payload, rounding, and precision according to the corresponding NUM operation. Members must still validate their actual parameter, control-model, and solution-domain constraints. Strict bits, final FP32-scaled four-ULP bounds, gradual underflow, copy behavior, and exact discrete branches inherit NUM.

Positive-weight normalization, signed kernels, local regression, and global inverse problems have different semantics and must not be treated as one alpha-blurring operation. See [color composition](FILTER_color_composition.md). Spatial extension, anchors, and origins follow the [boundary contract](FILTER_boundary_contract.md); structured outputs follow the [collection contract](FILTER_collections_contract.md). Shape depends only on descriptors; actual dependencies and dirty propagation are declared by each member.

## Dependencies and Acceptance

Each member’s support set is normative. Having a halo does not imply independent execution on an arbitrary cropped ROI; paging does not eliminate a whole-image dependency. Staged rounding, global connectivity, transforms, and iterative state must follow each member’s definition. Outputs are independently requestable; validating payloads of an unrequested component must not introduce a hidden whole-image dependency.

All members must pass the [common acceptance protocol](FILTER_oracle_protocol.md). Oracle reference scope is documented in the [oracle guide](../../../../oracle/ops/filter/README.md); it does not replace runtime acceptance. D1/D2 indicate draft maturity, not acceptance status.
